Research day 1:
CORS - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
*  If you try to make an HTTP request (using fetch, axios, or XMLHttpRequest) from an app/script running in the browser, the browser will block it by default.
* In order for the browser to permit an HTTP request, the origin of the client-side app must be whitelisted on the server and permitted by the server.
* CORS works like a firewall that only allows authorized connections from the browser to the server.






General Knowledge:

Middleware:
 
 Think of middleware as a series of steps or checkpoints that the request goes through before reaching its final destination. Each middleware function has access to the request object, the response object, and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle.
